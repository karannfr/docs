Agnet is building the infrastructure for scalable multi-agent intelligence.  
**Laddr**, our open-source framework, helps developers build, orchestrate, and scale intelligent multi-agent systems with ease.

AI teams and developers around the world use Laddr to manage distributed agent systems, trace execution, and scale parallel tasks effortlessly.

## Laddr gives you everything you need to build and scale agents:

- **Scalability** — Queue-based architecture with parallel agent workers.
- **Observability** — Docker-based dashboard with real-time traces, token usage, and system metrics.
- **Extensibility** — Connect your own tools, APIs, and external models with full control.
- **Configurability** — Flexible PostgreSQL and MinIO/S3 storage options.
- **APIs** — Exposed endpoints for jobs, traces, prompts, and system health.
